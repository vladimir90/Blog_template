                        <h1>Beijing Little Guide 3- Eating and Shopping</h1>
                        <p>In Beijing there is extremely large choice of food. You can find anything that you have in your country such as McDonalds, Pizza Hut and KFC. Also you can try similar to KFC Chinese chain of fast food known as Dicos. But lets speak
                            about Chinese food. This stuff you can find almost everywhere in Beijing.</p>
                        <p>Chinese culture is very diversified across all country so food is. I am not expert in Chinese cuisine but as I know from Chinese friends there are 8 great traditions of Chinese cuisine and each has long history and is specialized
                            in particular dishes and preparatory techniques. I am most familiar with Sichuan cuisine which is my favorite and it comes from southwestern Chinese province, offers pork, chicken, beef, duck or tofu with large amounts of chilly
                            peppers and garlic. Mushrooms, cabbage and peanuts can be added in some dishes too, for example in Gong Bao (chicken meat with spicy peppers and mentioned ingredients). That makes Sichuan province famous for extremely spicy
                            food. I am able to enjoy every day in these throat burning dishes. But if you cannot stand spicy food better don’t risk trying it. With other great traditions of Chinese cuisine I am less familiar and I just know that there
                            are Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Cantonese, Shandong, Hunan and Anhui cuisine traditions and that some are specialized in vegetables, bamboo, noodles, dim sum, fresh water fishes , sea food, ,beef ,lamb, spicy food or duck. But
                            I am not sure in which dishes is each of these cuisines specialized.</p>

                    <div class="row">


                        <p>First area where you have biggest choice of Chinese food is Gui Jie street also known as Ghost Street. In past it was street that was open since dawn till late night where merchants were selling various goods. It got nickname “Ghost Street”. There are two versions why it got such name. One is that  there were shops where were manufactured coffins for burials. Another is that merchants worked under lanterns in night and view seemed a bit ghostly. Today it is a street where you can find biggest choice of restaurants which are open until late night and some of them even 24h. I think that this street offers you largest choice of wonderful Chinese dishes on one place in Beijing as you can find here almost everything from various Chinese cuisine traditions: Sichuan spicy pork,  Gong Bao chicken, various types of noodles, jiao zi or bao zi with large choice of ingredients, seafood,  various soups, grilled or cooked vegetables, chuanr( lamb skewers), hotpot and of course main Beijing specialty- Beijing duck. I was in one of restaurants there but believe me whichever restaurant you choose you wont make a mistake. I can remember that once with Chinese friends we had Sichuan style pork, 1 seafood dish  from squids and vegetables, skewers (with grilled vegetables, grilled beacon and meatballs),  soup from chicken bones with mushrooms and other vegetables, onion and potato sour salad, jiaozi  and of course Beijing duck.  It isn’t complicated to reach this 1km long street you can take Subway Line 5 and get out at Beixinqiao station or Line 2 or Line 13 and get out at Dongzhimen station.</p>
