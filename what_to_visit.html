                  <h1>Beijing Little Guide-What to Visit?!</h1>
                  <p><span>Tiananmen Square</span> It is shame to be in Beijing and not to visit its most famous symbol and largest square in world. In Chinese it literary means “Gate of Heavenly Peace” and it is name of southern gate of imperial palace Forbidden City.  It isn’t European style square that you can find in Rome, Paris with pubs, caffes or parks. This is monumental square that symbolizes Chinese communist modern statehood. On that square Peoples Republic of China was founded. Expect large crowds of people young and old from cities and  from rural areas from every corner of China coming here to show respect to this square. On square you will see Mausoleum of Mao Zedong.  Also you will see there Monument to Peoples Heroes which is erected in honor of those who sacrificed their lives for communism and Chinese People. At northern part of square is Tiananmen Gate an entrance to Forbidden City. On its red wall is hanged large portrait of Chairman Mao. There is Parliament of China next to square known as Great Hall of People. Don’t miss flag raising ceremony ( at time of  sunrise) or flag lowering ceremony( at time of sunset)</p>
                  <h6>How to get there: Subway: Line1: get out at Tiananmen West or Tiananmen East or Line2: get out at Qianmen station.</h6>
                  <h6>Notification: There is high level of  security at square due to potential terrorist threat. So don’t bring any suspicious material because of security check that you must pass before you are let into square.</h6>

                    <p><span>Forbidden City</span> In past forbidden complex of halls and vast space determined only for Chinese  imperial elite and their servants. Life of Chinese Emperors was a mystery hidden behind tall red walls that are surrounding the palace. It served as a main residence of Chinese Emperors since XVII century when third Ming emperor moved capital from Nanjing to Beijing. Emperors lived there until 1911 when Empire was dissolved. They governed from this large complex and spent winter as well behind walls of this large imperial palace It was closed to public until 80ies when Chinese government started policy of opening up its economy and promoting tourism. So basically opening of gates of Forbidden City to eyes of people from all over world can symbolize opening of China. Maybe place isn’t most beautiful but you will be impressed by its size especially its large halls. Be prepared for large crowds of Chinese and tourists from all over the world.</p>
                    <h6>How to get there: If you are already on Tiananmen Square you can get through Tiananmen Gate and enter palace. I recommend it to visit it together with Tiananmen Square on same day.</h6>

Whole area is 5 times larger than Forbidden City. Just imagine it, come and see it by your eyes. In this palace mostly natural landscapes of lakes, green tree trunks and many willows dominates. There are only few pavilions remained complete. It was glorious palace built by Qianlong emperor of Qing dynasty during XVIII century. Very famous are remains of European Mansions which were built during Qianglongs rule by Italian architect Giuseppe Castaglione. These mansions were European style gardens with wonderful fountains.Unfortunately from these Western Mansions you can only find ruins, and stone pillars either on ground or standing. Also there remained stone maze with pavilion in the middle. It was robbed and  ruined by  French and British colonial forces during Second Opium War in 1860.  But anyway I recommend it to visit to this site.</p>

                      <p><span>Temple of Heaven:</span> Largest Temple in Beijing, dates from XV century and was built with purpose to continue tradition that was old for thousands of years already at that time. Chinese emperors were considered as son of heaven as I mentioned. Heaven played important role in Chinese cosmology and it interacted with Earth as all changes on Heaven were reflected on Earth, changes such as sun, wind, moon, rain, snow influenced Earth, by wind, light water, either by  positive harvest, blossoming or negative such as floods or winter storms. So at beginning of each lunar year emperor personally had to pray to the Heaven for good harvests. If harvests were good and people happy it meant he has mandate from Heaven. If harvests were bad, flood or starving occurred it meant that he isn’t supported by Heaven anymore and he could be overthrown. Todays Temple of Heaven is open for visitors. It is best to come during sunny days with clear sky as watching 32m tall cupola touching sky is amazing. This cupola is called Hall of Prayer where prayers were held.  Check inside of Hall and its beautiful ornaments.  Also visit Imperial Vault of Heaven similar but smaller structure within complex. There are many cypress trees nearby buildings which are very old some of them for 500 years.  On road to third major place is echo wall. Where prayers were held and loud music in order to reach Heaven. Shout out some wish that you have it is believed that Heaven will hear wish and it will be fulfilled.  Finally there is big Circular Mound Altar made from stone with circle in middle that symbolizes center or heart of Heaven.  Here was final part of prayer  done when sacrifice for Heaven was brought by burning some animal. You will see people standing for shortly in that place. Do the same and you will feel like really being in center between Earth and Heaven and like hat everything is around you.</p>

                        <p><span>Hutongs-</span>  Most of Chinese people associate this with traditional spirit of Beijing.  These are alleys composed of traditional courtyard shiheyuan houses. Often such alleys surrounded water wells so everyone from alley can use them. Hutong streets are very narrow. When you pass through them on both sides are entrances to shiheyuan houses  and walls. Behind walls of house are  inner gardens. While elite lived in palaces and mansions here lived Beijing grassrooters. Closer to Forbidden City were houses of aristocracy and merchants while further of those poorer, sellers and laborers. More rich houses were decorated in red and green colored walls and beams below roofs. Those less rich and poorer were usually grey with red doors and modest decorations composed of 2 red lanterns hung on wall. Passing through hutongs you can feel spirit of old Beijing and way of life that was led in past. Some hutongs became commercialized like next to Shichihai lake, Liulichang street or Nanluoguxiang street. But a bit broader around Shichihai lake old style hutongs are preserved and on both sides of Nanluoguxiang,( same metro station on Line 6 And also southern from Liulichang( Hepingmen station Line 2) you can find old unchanged alleys.  Also nearby Qianmen there are such narrow old alleys. About commercialized hutongs I will speak in some other articles that will be about shopping and souvenirs and leisure.</span></p>
                        <p>I personally prefer old untouched alleys between Jingshan, Beihai and Houhai. When I was there  Old lifestyle was present. Few bicycle drivers passed next to me. Many of bikes were parked near gates.  Gates were red some of them even faded and very old. Some of gates on both sides were decorated with 2 red typical Chinese lanterns. Few gates were open and inside were visible flowers and smaller trees in inner gardens of hutong houses. In one of inner gardens I saw old man who was sitting alone and playing erhu, ancient Chinese traditional instrument.  Through other opened gates were visible people doing some house and garden works. Gardening for Chinese people who live in hutongs is important hobby and way of life. In front of one gate was fixer of bikes in old faded clothes and was repairing wheel of one bicycle, working hard and sweating to earn money for his family. Houses here were grey with a bit dilapidated facades, but it is point. They should look like ordinary, like 100-150 ago. One street seller of fruits when we were buying bananas was friendly towards us. On few corners were groups of neighbors eating noodles and drinking Yanjing beer. I saw very friendly relations among people living in hutongs- eating together on streets, playing Chinese chess and everyone speaking and smiling to everyone. Simply their close relations were reminding me on friendliness and close ties among people living in villages in Serbia. That’s how life in old China looks like, those who will see it here they can conclude same as me I hope old lifestyle in this area will never die, that this area will never be changed and that these hutongs wont experience commercialization, opening of clothes shops, crowds, big attention of tourists, or in another case that all area will be completely destroyed and replaced by some modern shopping center or skyscrapers. That was destiny to many hutongs. I heard few times from some Chinese friends that this area is protected from any changes by state authorities. Old life style is more rare and rare.  It is fading like walls of hutongs but still exists and will exist.</p>
